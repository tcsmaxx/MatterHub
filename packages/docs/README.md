---

This project simulates bridges to publish your entities from Home Assistant to any Matter-compatible controller like
Alexa, Apple Home or Google Home. Using Matter, those can be connected easily using local communication without the need
of port forwarding etc.

## Known issues and limitations

### Device Type Support

This project does not yet support all available device types in the matter specification.
In addition, controllers like Alexa or Google Home do not support all device types, too.

To check which types are supported, please review the
[list of supported device types](./Supported%20Device%20Types.md).

### Alexa

- Alexa cannot pair with a bridge which has too many devices attached. It seems to have a limit of
  about 80-100 devices
- Alexa needs at least one Amazon device which supports Matter to pair with a Matter device.
  If you only have a third party smart speaker which supports Alexa, this isn't enough.

### Google Home

- Google Home needs an actual Google Hub to connect a Matter device. Just using the GH app isn't enough.
- Google Home can deny the Matter device under certain conditions because it is not a certified Matter
  device. You need to follow
  [this guide](https://github.com/project-chip/matter.js/blob/main/docs/ECOSYSTEMS.md#google-home-ecosystem)
  to register your hub.

### Network setup

The Matter protocol is designed to work best with UDP and IPv6 within your local network. At the moment some
manufacturers built their controllers to be compatible with IPv4, too, but this can break at any time with any update.

Many users report connection issues when using VLANs or firewalls, where HAMH and the assistant devices (Alexa, Google
Home, ...) are not placed in the same network segment. Please make sure to review the
[common connectivity issues](./Guides/Connectivity%20Issues.md).

## Getting started

To get things up and running, please follow the [installation guide](./Getting%20Started/Installation.md).
